# SIAM: Spatial and Intensity Awareness Module for 3D Cerebrovascular Segmentation
This repository is the official implementation of the paper "SIAM: Spatial and Intensity Awareness Module for 3D Cerebrovascular Segmentation".

## Overview
![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/04/16/8bDqWxdE6wTQmo3.png)
- We propose a novel spatial and intensity awareness module that guides the model to focus on cerebrovascular structures’ unique spatial distribution characteristics and pixel intensity features.
- The proposed module, designed to integrate seamlessly without disrupting the backbone network, facilitates rapid deployment within existing segmentation networks.
- Extensive experiments were conducted across datasets of diverse modalities, substantiating the efficacy of SIAM in elevating model segmentation performance across both normal and limited training datasets.
## Visualization Experiment Results

1. Visualization of segmentation comparisons on the Axial and Sagittal planes of the IXI dataset. The pixels rendered in yellow represent the vasculature. Each example is presented in two rows, depicting the prediction results from 100% and 50% of the training set, respectively. The models are arranged in the following order from left to right: Ours, U-Net, V-Net, ER-Net, CSR-Net, UNETR, and IS.

2. The 3D reconstruction was conducted on the Brain-MR dataset with 100% training set, where red dots represent the network’s predicted vasculature, and blue dots indicate the absent portions (vessels that failed to be predicted) compared to the ground truth labels.

## Usage

### Requirements

The recommend python and package version:

* python>=3.10.0
* pytorch>=1.13.1

### Train

here we use an example(Traning 3D Unet) to teach you how use this repository

```BASH
python train.py config=unet
```
To specify the folder name for the current save, you can modify the corresponding parameter using config.XXX=XXX.
```BASH
python train.py config=unet config.name=unet-1
```
All files during the model training process will be saved in ./logs/unet-1

all parameter can be setted in `conf/unet.yaml`
#### Global configuration
Considering that many settings are common to all configuration files, such as `data_path`, `num_epochs`, etc., to avoid repetitive work, we have placed these common parameters in `conf/config.yaml`. All configuration files will have these properties from `config.yaml`.

Taking `num_workers` (defaulted to 18 in `config.yaml`) as an example, the priority of parameter overriding is as follows:
Command line argument `config.num_workers=20` > `num_workers=18` in `data_3d.yaml` > Default value `num_workers=18` in `config.yaml`.

#### File Structure
Traning logs will be saved like this:
```
./logs/ying_tof (Corresponding saved folder: ./logs/config.name)
└── 2023-11-24 (Date: year-month-day)
    └── 17-05-02 (Time: hour-minute-second)
        ├── .hydra (Configuration save files)
        │   ├── config.yaml (Configuration for this running)
        │   ├── hydra.yaml
        │   └── overrides.yaml
        ├── train_3d.log (Log during training)
        └── train_tensorboard (Tensorboard folder)
            └── events.out.tfevents.1700816703.medai.115245.0 (file for Tensorboard)
```
### Predict

run the code

```BASH
python predict.py config=unet config.ckpt=XXX
```
`WARNING`: ckpt must be the absolute path of the model, not the relative path
```
./results/ (Root folder for results)
└── unet (Model name: unet)
    └── 2023-12-04 (Date: year-month-day)

            │   ├── pred-0000.mhd (Prediction file 0 in MHD format)
            │   ├── pred-0000.zraw (Prediction file 0 in ZRAW format)

            │   └── ... (Additional prediction files)
            └── predict.log (Log file for prediction)
```


## Create your own configuration

create new file in path `/conf/config`, file name ends with `.yaml`.

For example, if you wanna use 3D Vnet, you can create `vnet.yaml`, and then set all parameters you wanna set.

### how to use the parameters in `yaml` file

`config.PARAM`: replace `PARAM` with the parameters you wanna use

### Modify train.py and predict.py to match your model

in train.py, add these codes after the last model

```Python
elif config.network == 'NETWORK':
    from models.three_d.NETWORK import NETWORK
    model = NETWORK()
```

`NETWORK`: means the network you wanna use
